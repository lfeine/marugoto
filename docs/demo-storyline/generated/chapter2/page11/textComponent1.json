  "markdownContent" : "Now, rather annoyingly, the presenter herself refers to exactly the article you were thinking of, by John Crowley. She talks about an image that also appears in Crowley’s essay, of a Cuban plantation from the late 1850s. But you find it hard to focus on her argument, partly because it’s quite complicated, and partly because you’re thinking about the email you received from Natalie.<br><br>After the panel finishes, you want to approach the presenter—her name is Lorraine Okada—to ask about the Hawaiian painting. But before you catch her attention, you see a cocky-looking middle-aged man approach her and give her his business card. The room is full and you can only catch snippets of their conversation. He’s saying something about what a strong presentation it was.<br><br>Despite appearances—you’re not a fan of slicked-back hair in professorial types—the man seems to be asking some really interesting questions. Something about recovering voices of the labourers, and the methodologies of hearing silence. And something about Native Hawaiians in the Hawaiian painting—about how they seem to be absent but arguably they’re not. And then something about the ways the painting constructs race between Hawai‘i and Japan.<br><br> You can’t see his name-badge but you think it would be smart to talk to him after you’ve introduced yourself to Lorraine Okada. After all, his questions might be of interest to Prof Moira and her RaCE project."
