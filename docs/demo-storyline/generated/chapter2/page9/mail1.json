She’s looking for “volunteers” to help prepare some of her teaching for her Block Seminar in two weeks. I know you’ve got plenty of other things going on at the moment but she told me she would be in touch.<br><br> Just FYI. No need to reply!<br><br> Let me know when you’re back and hopefully we can get a coffee.<br><br>Best,<br>Natalie<br><br> *Dr. Natalie Tasukarru<br> Postdoctoral Assistant, Department of History*"
