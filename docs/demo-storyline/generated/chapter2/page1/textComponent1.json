You ask her advice about whether to help Prof Moira with teaching or prioritise your own PhD research. Natalie is ambivalent. Of course, your own PhD should be your priority: the best PhD is a finished PhD, as someone once told her. On the other hand, you never know what opportunities might open up for you if you help your supervisor.<br><br>You tell her about Lorraine Okada’s presentation at the conference, in particular about the Japanese in Hawai‘i (you know that Natalie’s own research is to do with modern Japanese history). She’s intrigued by the Strong painting, and says she might ask some of her colleagues in Japan about it."
