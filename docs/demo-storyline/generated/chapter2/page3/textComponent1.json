  "markdownContent" : "After keeping you waiting for forty-five minutes, Prof Moira shows you into her office. She seems somewhat irritable. “So?” she asks, “How was the conference?”<br><br>You wonder whether she has read the email summary you sent her—at her own request. So you start again, presuming that she’ll be more interested in hearing about the keynote speaker (a let-down, to be honest), and the other professors with their smug in-jokes (you don’t say this, naturally: you say that their presentations were excellent). As you talk, Prof Moira takes off her horn-rimmed glasses and stares at her bookshelf.<br><br>But as you start to talk about Lorraine Okada’s paper, she turns towards you; and when you show her the Strong painting on your computer, she puts her glasses back on and murmurs, “Interesting.” You continue with the question posed by that slick but substantive professor—where are the Native Hawaiians in the story? <br><br>“Exactly!” she exclaims. “And look at the overseer on the horse—a European, naturally; and the little boy with his Chinese haircut. There’s racial hierarchies entangled in this story of sugar production. This is what RaCE is all about! Oh, it’s such a pity you won’t be helping me with the Block Seminar!<br><br>”Really? So far as you recall, you simply asked for more time to make a decision. “Of course you did,” Prof Moira smiles. “But you will understand when I say that I gave this opportunity instead to—ah, what’s his name? A charming young man just finishing his Master’s. Really, no hard feelings from my side. Absolutely not.”"
