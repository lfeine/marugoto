  "markdownContent" : "After keeping you waiting for forty-five minutes, Mr Fridrich shows you into her office to introduce you with new conference topics. He seems somewhat irritable. “So?” he asks, “How was the conference?”<br><br>You wonder whether he has read the email summary you sent him—at his own request. So you start again, presuming that he’ll be more interested in hearing about the keynote speaker (a let-down, to be honest), and the other professors with their smug in-jokes (you don’t say this, naturally: you say that their presentations were excellent). As you talk, Mr Fridrich interups you with “Alright, stop there! Let's concentrate for the new conference and prepare all the contents!“"
