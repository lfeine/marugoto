Hope that didn’t cause you trouble!<br><br> The correct phone number for my friend, Emi Ederson, is 808 499 5837. Her email is:<br> <eederson@hawaii.edu> <br> Her husband Al is also very nice. They said they would email you as soon as you’ve arrived.<br><br> Keep me updated on your progress. It’s only a short trip but I’m sure it’s better than nothing!<br><br> Best wishes,<br> MM<br><br> Professor Meredith Moira <br>Dean of the Humanities Teaching Award Nominee, 2018",
