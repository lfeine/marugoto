You did your ESTA application in such a rush that it’s all a bit of a blur.*<br>\t“So to be clear: you don’t know where you’re staying, or who you’re staying with?”<br>\t*It doesn’t sound so great when he puts it like that. He has your ESTA form, so you say you can check the information in your phone.*<br>\t“No computers or mobile devices in this zone. If you cannot remember these details, then I must question you further. So, let’s try again: where are you staying in Honolulu?”<br>\t*You remember: Ala Moana.*<br> \t“Ala Moana hotel?That’s not what it says on your form.<br>*”He stares at you.*<br> “OK, tell me what you’ll be doing during your time in the US of A.”<br>\t*This should be an easy question—but in your exhausted and now slightly panicked state you give a jumbled answer.*<br>\t“You say you’re making a radio program? So you’re a journalist? Do you have press credentials?”<br>\t*No, no—this is all going horribly wrong. If only you could access your emails—you remember that Lorraine always left a contact number in her signature. You don’t know whether this is her cell or her home number, but it would be a start.“*<br>[Sir\/madam], step aside and wait for my colleague, please.”",
