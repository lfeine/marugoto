Though it’s early in the morning, you can’t wait to get started—when you skyped with Lorraine a few days ago, she said you should get in touch when you arrive and you could go out for breakfast together. But now you’re actually on the ground, you think you’ll perhaps drop your bags at your apartment—one of Prof Moira’s friends sorted out something for you in Ala Moana at a very cheap rate. Then, as you’re feeling fresh and raring to go, perhaps you’ll swim, shower and make it to the archives for the afternoon."
