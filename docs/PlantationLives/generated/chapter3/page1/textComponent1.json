  "markdownContent" : "In the couple of days since Prof Moira made her offer to send you to Hawai‘i, you’ve been in such a rush that you’ve not had any time to think. You know that you have six days in Hawai‘i before you must catch your long flight home: six days in order to gather enough materials to write a three- or four-minute script, either for a podcast or for a radio programme (you’ve heard both mentioned since you spoke to Prof Moira, and you’re now not exactly clear which it is). Plus, during these six days, you have the chance to scope out any sources which may help your own PhD research develop.<br><br> But now, on the plane, you begin to relax—and you take out from your bag a photocopy which Natalie gave you from one of her own source collections. It’s a contract from the first Japanese migrants to Hawai‘i in 1885. As you read it, you consider that your own obligations are fairly light compared to these poor migrants."
