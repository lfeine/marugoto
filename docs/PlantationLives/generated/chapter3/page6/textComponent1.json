  "markdownContent" : "You are taken to an interview room in the holding area of the airport. There, all your personal items—phone, computer, passport, hand luggage, and your watch, too—are confiscated. All you are allowed to retain, because they seem harmless, is your notebook and a pen.<br><br> You have no idea how long you will have to wait here. To kill the time, you could reflect on your experiences of trying to cross borders in the twenty-first century, and how you think they might compare to those of the Japanese migrants in the Strong painting, or those whose contract you read.<br><br> Or you could kill time by reviewing the primary and secondary sources you have gathered in your notebook thus far, and try to identify what research aims you want to achieve in Hawai‘i after you are released (if you are released). Identifying some kind of overarching research question now may help bring greater focus both to your PhD research and to the radio programme you have now told the US authorities you are making.<br><br>Either way, you can make notes/annotations directly in your notebook."
