  "markdownContent" : "{{user.name}}, we have reviewed your case. We still need to know where you will be staying in Honolulu. But because you are a graduate student and you have a professor vouching for you, we will allow you to check your electronic devices and see if you can find an alternative address or contact number there. You may use our telephone if it is a local number. But next time you come to the United States, you need to get yourself organized. Make a call now please.‚Äù",
