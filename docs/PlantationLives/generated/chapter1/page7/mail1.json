I’m sure you’ll understand that the teaching situation is quite an emergency and I’m grateful for your help.<br><br>The first task you can help me on is to introduce Stuart Hall’s concept of “race as a floating signifier” to the block seminar students. It is a big concept and you can do some work in the library when you come home, but in the meantime, to give you a short introduction, there’s a wonderful video which has extracts from one of his lectures: [https://vimeo.com/87470149 link](https://vimeo.com/87470149) (if the link doesn’t work, I’m sure you can other extracts from it online).<br><br>Have a look and after you’re back (not now—you’re busy!), please summarize the key argument for us to discuss. Please come to my office at 9am next Tuesday.<br><br>Incidentally, with this teaching-preparation experience, I think we can tick off another of the boxes in your “PhD Portfolio”. That should please the Dean no end.<br><br>Safe journey home and get some rest,<br><MM<br><br> Professor Meredith Moira<br> Dean of the Humanities Teaching Award Nominee, 2018",
