I can’t imagine what time it must be where you are…<br><br>I surely won’t keep you long, but I just wanted to follow up on my email—oh, you didn’t receive it yet? How strange, I’m sure I sent it to you!<br><br> Well, I just wanted to say, it would be so wonderful if you could help me preparing for my Block Seminar. You know, it takes an award-winning teacher to see one, and I do see one in you, potentially. And I think it will be so beneficial for you to teach Stuart Hall’s ideas to a bigger class at this stage in your career development. What do you think?<br><br> No, of course! You’re busy at the conference. Obviously I would prefer if you could tell me now, but if you need more time to make your decision then I completely understand. Completely. And how is the conference, incidentally? I do hope it was worth my sending you",
