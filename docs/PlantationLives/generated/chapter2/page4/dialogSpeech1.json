She seems to be over it because she was talking a lot about that painting and representations of race. Good work.<br><br> In fact, I think she was excited about it because she needs to do outreach and impact for her RaCE project. How her team’s work is relevant for society, that kind of thing. She volunteered in her original application to do a podcast, and you know what that means? I’m organizing a podcast series for her. Lucky me! So this is what she wants to know: does that painting story have any kind of connection to contemporary Hawai‘i? If so, there would be potential for you to produce something on the historical roots of a contemporary problem. What do you think?<br><br> Yes, it’s extra work: you have to write a script for a three- or four-minute podcast. But here’s the thing. You can also apply for funding—and if you get it, they would send you to Hawai‘i for ‘fieldwork’. So it’s up to you. Do you want to do the podcast and application, or do you just want to focus on your own PhD research?”",
