And the sad thing is, there’s a budget line especially for Oi! which cannot be used for serious academic research. Her idea for RaCE was to collaborate with the local radio station—they have a late-night programme called “Culture Vulture” and Prof Moira promised them a short slot, something like a five-minute report from the field. <br><br>“They’ve been pestering me for weeks now,” she continues, “and their deadline is in just ten days. But now I see it! You could do a radio report on your new topic!”"
