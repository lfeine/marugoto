  "markdownContent" : "While you are considering Prof Moira’s offer, you decide to follow up one of the leads that Lorraine emailed you. The book she mentioned, A Pictorial History of the Japanese in Hawai‘i, isn’t in your university library’s online catalogue, but you go along to the library’s main information desk to see if they can either purchase it or get it on Inter Library Loan. <br><br>When the desk staff hear that you are interested in Hawaiian history, they tell you about a big collection of digitized newspapers from America, called “Chronicling America”. Look it up online, and list up in the box on the right how many newspapers are available for studying the history of Hawai‘i in the 1880s. Note the language of publication of these newspapers.<br><br>As you do this task, you remember that in the same volume and issue of the American Historical Review that you found Crowley’s article about sugar machines, there was also a useful-looking article about the historian’s relationship to digitized sources. As you did before, also copy and paste the abstract for this article into your notebook."
