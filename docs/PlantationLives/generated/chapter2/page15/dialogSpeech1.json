There was me, thinking you were in the Boss’s good books because of agreeing to help prepare for her Block Seminar, and instead I’ve just had her on the phone going on about the entitled attitude of the millennial generation… She seems to forget that I am a proud millennial too…<br><br>So let’s get this straight: she offered you a trip to Hawai‘i—a free trip to Hawai‘i—and you said you needed some time to think about it? I love it! Moira just assumes everyone will bend to her will if She bestows kindnesses. Good for you for standing up to her!<br><br>But, er, yeah. The downside is that the Hawai‘i offer is off. Oh well, that gives you and me time for that coffee—sometime next week? Message me, OK?”",
