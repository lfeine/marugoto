  "markdownContent" : "After keeping you waiting for twenty-five minutes, Prof Moira shows you into her office. “Before we talk about the teaching,” she says, “tell me about the conference!” So you begin with the keynote speaker (a let-down, to be honest), and the other professors with their smug in-jokes (you don’t say this, naturally: you say that their presentations were excellent). As you talk, Prof Moira takes off her horn-rimmed glasses and stares at her bookshelf.<br><br> But as you start to talk about Lorraine Okada’s paper, she turns towards you; and when you show her the Strong painting on your computer, she puts her glasses back on and murmurs, “Wonderful.” Encouraged, you show her the email you’ve just received from Lorraine, with fortuitous timing—the “Pictorial History” book and the online news article, which you read together.<br><br>“This is fascinating!” Prof Moira exclaims. “Look, you have a dispute about contemporary Native Hawaiian land rights and the longer history of the sugar plantation industry—and you have a painting which is a window into that longer history. And look at the names of some of the people quoted in the interview—Kuriyama, Sousa. They’re are the descendants of the people in the painting! This is what RaCE is all about! Oh, do let me call me call my Impact Officer!”<br><br> Prof Moira steps over to her office telephone and starts talking animatedly. Now it is your turn to stare at the bookshelves."
