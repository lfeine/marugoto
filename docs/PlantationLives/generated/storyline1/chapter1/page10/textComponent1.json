But perhaps because the professor was asking her about the Hawaiian painting, Lorraine has projected it once again on the screen. While you’re waiting to speak to her, take a look at some of the painting’s details—you can get right up close to it by using the zoom function. Open your notebook and note down anything else you may now notice in the painting. And try to remember some of the questions that the professor was asking Lorraine about it.So now you know: the painting is by Joseph D. Strong and dates from 1885. You now have a starting place for your research—you’re potentially interested in representations of labor on the Hawaiian sugar plantations, perhaps in comparison with similar representations from the Atlantic world. Finish writing up any notes you may want to take before going to the airport to catch your flight home."
