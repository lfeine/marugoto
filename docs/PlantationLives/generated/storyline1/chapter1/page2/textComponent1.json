  "markdownContent" : "Your PhD supervisor, Prof Moira, has sent you to an international conference, called “Race, Place and Space across History”. At first, you were very excited by the glamour of the “international”: you bought a guide book to the city, and were planning to take a river cruise through the Old Town one afternoon.<br><br> But now you have arrived, you realise there will be no time to do any sightseeing—unless you could do so between the hours of 1am and 5am, when you lie awake feeling most alert. Otherwise, it’s panel after panel, with a quick nap in-between if you have time to make it back to your room. You realize that even the city’s name is unimportant—your life these past two days has simply been hotel conference rooms and overpriced coffee.<br><br> Prof Moira has sent you for your own benefit, she insists. She is paying for your trip from one of her research project funds. This is, of course, most generous of her—but the fact that her current research project is called Racialism and Culture Entangled (RaCE) suggests to you that she has ulterior motives for your trip. Indeed, she has specifically asked you to go to particular presentations, and to report back on any interesting scholars you may meet during the breaks between panel sessions. (You’re not yet sure whether her project will refund your coffee expenses.)"
